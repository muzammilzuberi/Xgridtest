The architecure used will be micro services, it will enable us to make cross-language APIs,
for example we can use Nodejs for User details API, but python is better chocie for recommendation algorithms so we can design an API
in python for posts ranking on newsfeed.
This architecture will also enable us to deploy and manage parts of thev app independentaly. 
For message queuing we can use Rabbit mq.
For caching we can you redis cache. 
We can first design APIs using yaml, and then implement them.
